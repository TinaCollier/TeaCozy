# TeaCozy

## What I Made!

<p>In this project, Codecademy challenged me to recreate the HTML and CSS of a design spec and include flexbox in my code. I was provided an example page of a Tea shop with some paramters. </>
  
### How I Did It!

<p>First, I recreated the HTML text for the entire page. I began working my way down the page adding the CSS elements. I began with the *body* tag, then the *header*. Each portion of the page, I created *div* within *div*. I had to create several classes to make my code work.</p>

### What I Found Challenging

<p>I found using flexbox threw a wrench in my plans, but it made the webpage flow smoother. I had to use Google and ask for help several times to get the CSS code just right. I had a great time doing this project and I look forward to the next challenge.</p>
